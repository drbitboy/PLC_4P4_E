## Stretch Wrap Machine - an exploration

Original source of the code:  https://www.plctalk.net/qanda/showthread.php?t=138365

The initial problem that was solved was that the turntable encoder pulses were not being detected by the PLC.  The owner of the machine fixed that and moved on.

I spent some time understanding the program, primarily as a puzzle.

Manifest (Initial commit):

* 4P4_E.zip - Original code
* 4P4_E_with_comments.pdf/.RSS - same as 4P4E.zip above, but with data descriptions
* 4P4_E_drbitboy_refactor_00.pdf/.RSS - cleaner, better organized, and hopefully equivalent code, with less than half the rungs
